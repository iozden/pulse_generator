# Arduino Pulse Generator with Python Interface
This is a two channel funtion generator made from an Arduino Due board. 
The control interface is written in Python.
The pulses are generated by using the timers and interrupt funtions of the Arduino chip. Therefore, the pulse generator is very fast with minimum pulse width is in the order of few ns.
The generator has two pulse generator channels, DIO pins 0 and 8 of the Arduino board. 
DIO pin 34 is used for external trigger.
